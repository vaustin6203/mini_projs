Puzzle Solver

An artificial intelligence that can solve arbitrary state space traversal problems. Specifically, given a graph of possible states, my AI will find the optimal route from the start state to a goal state.
This AI can solve a wide variety of problems, including finding driving directions, solving a 15 puzzle, and finding word ladders. This AI was implemented using the A* algorithm.
